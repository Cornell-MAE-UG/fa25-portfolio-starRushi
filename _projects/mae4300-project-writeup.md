# MAE4300 Project Writeup
**rp548 Rushika Prasad's MAE4300 Project Writeup on the Boeing 747 Plane Crash.**

## Project Summary
Over the course of this semster, in MAE 4300, we have analyzed the two infamous Boeing 747 plane crashes to understand how and why it happened, the factors at play from several different frame works, and how to prevent such disasters.

# Activity 6: Boeing 737 MAX Case Study
**Course:** Engineering Ethics  
**Focus:** Identifying ethical issues and narrowing to the most consequential issues

## Prompt 1: Identifying Ethical Issues (10 Questions)
Ethics concerns actions that can seriously impact the lives of others, directly or indirectly. Below are ten ethical issues posed as questions. The set spans organizational vs. individual responsibility, technical vs. communication failures, and immediate vs. long-term consequences.

1. **Regulatory independence:** Should there be greater separation between central regulatory agencies and the companies they monitor?  
   - ASME: Integrity, public welfare, avoiding conflicts of interest

2. **Test flight sufficiency:** Should regulators require more test flights before certification?  
   - ASME: Competence, due care, safety-first

3. **Transparency of testing:** Should safety testing and certification evidence be public by default?  
   - ASME: Honesty, transparency, informed consent of stakeholders

4. **Minimum development timelines:** Should minimum development timelines or safety gates be mandated to prevent rushed redesigns?  
   - ASME: Responsible judgment, prioritizing safety over schedule pressure

5. **Punishment for software obfuscation:** Should punishment increase when companies intentionally obscure safety-critical software behavior?  
   - ASME: Integrity, accountability, truthful communication

6. **Whistleblower incentives:** Should stronger rewards and protections exist for whistleblowers exposing safety risk?  
   - ASME: Public welfare, ethical courage, accountability

7. **Pilot training subsidies:** Should governments subsidize mandatory pilot training when new systems significantly change handling?  
   - ASME: Public safety, professional responsibility to ensure safe operation

8. **Independent software review:** Should safety-critical flight software be audited by independent teams, including automated analysis tools (for example, formal verification or AI-assisted review)?  
   - ASME: Competence, due diligence, risk mitigation

9. **Regulator capability building:** Should companies be required to train regulators on system changes and technical details to prevent asymmetric knowledge?  
   - ASME: Integrity, informed decision-making, transparency

10. **Post-incident grounding:** After the first crash, should the aircraft have been decommissioned or grounded until full causal clarity and mitigation were complete?  
   - ASME: Hold paramount safety, precautionary principle, accountability

## Prompt 2: Narrowing the Focus (5 Issues + Justification)
Goal: prioritize depth over breadth by selecting the five most decisive ethical issues and explaining why they matter more than the remaining five in this case.

### 1) Regulator and Company Separation
**Why it is critically important:**  
A lack of independence between regulator and manufacturer enabled known danger to be minimized, delayed, or normalized. Stronger separation could have prevented certification decisions that tolerated unacceptable risk, making it plausibly decisive for preventing both crashes.

**Why it is more significant than the issues not selected:**  
This is upstream. If the oversight structure is compromised, improvements in training, tooling, or policy can be neutralized because the decision process itself becomes captured or overly deferential.

**ASME linkage:** integrity, conflict-of-interest avoidance, and holding public safety paramount.

---

### 2) Public Testing and Transparency
**Why it is critically important:**  
Testing and certification evidence being hidden reduced external accountability and blocked independent scrutiny. If testing results were public or if public disclosure requirements existed, it would have been harder to bury or reframe safety-critical behavior.

**Why it is more significant than the issues not selected:**  
Transparency creates enforceable accountability. Without visibility, even competent regulators and pilots operate under incomplete information.

**ASME linkage:** honesty, transparency, and enabling informed stakeholder judgment.

---

### 3) Minimum Development Timelines and Safety Gates
**Why it is critically important:**  
An accelerated development timeline increased the likelihood of engineering shortcuts, weak design trade-offs, and insufficient mitigation exploration. A mandated minimum schedule, or mandatory safety gates that cannot be bypassed by business pressure, would reduce the chance of deploying fragile or hidden safety logic.

**Why it is more significant than the issues not selected:**  
This targets systemic incentive pressure. It does not remove financial incentives, but it constrains how much schedule pressure can override due care.

**ASME linkage:** responsible judgment, competence, and prioritizing safety over schedule.

---

### 4) Software Obfuscation and Withholding Safety-Critical Behavior
**Why it is critically important:**  
Obfuscation of safety-critical software (including its behavior and failure modes) prevented operators from understanding what the system could do and how it could fail. This directly affected situational awareness and the ability to respond effectively under time pressure.

**Why it is more significant than the issues not selected:**  
This is causally close to the accident chain. Hidden software behavior is not merely a governance flaw; it directly reduces safe operation.

**ASME linkage:** integrity, truthful communication, and accountability for safety-critical design.

---

### 5) Decommissioning or Grounding After the First Crash
**Why it is critically important:**  
The second crash should have been unnecessary. After the first fatal incident, a precautionary approach would have prioritized public safety by grounding until the failure mode was fully understood and mitigations were verified.

**Why it is more significant than the issues not selected:**  
This is the clearest preventable pivot point. Even if earlier decisions failed, grounding after the first crash could still have prevented further loss of life.

**ASME linkage:** hold safety paramount, precautionary action under uncertainty, public welfare.

## Notes on Scope
This activity focuses on identifying ethical issues and selecting the most consequential five for deeper analysis. It emphasizes systemic causes (oversight structure and transparency) alongside accident-proximate causes (hidden software behavior and post-incident grounding decisions).
